## Assurance principles 
High-level design principles related to the assurance processes 
* assurance should be lightweight but appropriate 
* testing should be automated where possible to establish technical conformance 
* a level of self-certified solution assurance will be made available to organisations deploying the APIs 
* all artefacts related to assurance and testing should be made available as part of the ecosystem (public domain) prior to engaging in a formal NHS Digital assurance process 
* a set of evidence based around self-assurance activities will speed up the assurance process

Consumer Testing 

Details of what activities form the basis of testing for consumer applications 

Table of contents 

Technical accreditation 

Technical conformance 

Solution assurance 

 

Technical accreditation 

Consumer systems SHALL be (or have previously been) tested and accreditated to establish baseline Spine connectivity prerequisites: 

N3 connectivity / ASID / PKI Certificate 

Personal Demographic Service (PDS) integration 

Spine Directory Service (SDS) integration 

 

Technical conformance 

Consumer systems SHALL be tested for technical conformance of the following before they can be listed on the product catalogue:

Solution assurance 

Solution assurance ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation consuming the APIs.
